"# USA_baby_names" 

The US authorities have registered the names of all US citizens born since 1880. The record is publicly available. 
For data protection reasons, only names that have been used at least 5 times are listed in the data record.

# Libraries
- pandas
- matplotlib

## Overview
This Python script analyzes the popularity of baby names in the United States since 1880 based on publicly available records. It provides insights into the distribution of names, trends over time, and allows users to track the popularity of specific names:

1. Importing Libraries: Import necessary libraries for data analysis and visualizations.

2. Defining a function that can read from the different data .txt files and return a dataframe for a given year

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Examine different aspects of the dataset such as: total births by year, gender-specific births and names, name diversity over the years, most popular names, tracking a name over time and visualizations of the results


## Getting Started
Follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository: Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine.

2. Install Dependencies: Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed. You can install them using the following command:
``````
pip install pandas matplotlib 
``````
For Jupyter notebooks :
``````
!pip install pandas matplotlib 
``````
3. Data File: Several .txt files are stored in the /data folder.

4. Run the Code

5. While running the code a new csv file with the combinded data will be created in the data folder.


## Project Output
The project output includes data analysis and visualization in the Jupyter Notebook, insights into baby names given in USA since 1880, as well as a Python codebase that can be adapted for similar data analysis projects.
